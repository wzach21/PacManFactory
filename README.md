# PacMan Factory
A coding assignment from MIT xPro utilizing JavaScript that adds pacmen to the screen when you click "Add PacMan"then upon clicking "Start Game" sends them off in random directions and they bounce off the walls

# How To Run
Clone this repository then open the index.html file. Click the "Add PacMan" button to add PacMen to the screen then click the "Start Game" button to run the script.

# Future Improvements
Sometimes when creating PacMen they will appear on the screen and block the "Add PacMan" or "Start Game" buttons rendering the program unusable. Plan to either make them appear behind the buttons or make it so they do not appear in that area at all.

Plan to add input to specify the amount of PacMen vs individually clicking once per PacMan.

Make it so the PacMen will bounce off eacher aswell to prevent them overlapping
